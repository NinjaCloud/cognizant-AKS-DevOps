## Step 1: Switch to Root User
To ensure you have the necessary privileges to install Docker, switch to the root user:
```bash
sudo su
```

---

## Step 2: Update the System
Run the following command to update the package lists:
```bash
apt update -y
```

---

## Step 3: Install Required Tools
Install the `curl` utility, which is required to download the Docker installation script:
```bash
apt install curl -y
```

---

## Step 4: Install Docker
Run the Docker installation script:
```bash
curl -SSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

---

## Step 5: Verify Docker Installation
1. Check if the Docker service is running:
   ```bash
   service docker status
   ```
   The output should show that the Docker service is **active**.

2. Verify the Docker version to confirm successful installation:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

---

## Step 6: Allow Non-Root Users to Run Docker Commands
By default, Docker requires root privileges to execute commands. To enable a non-root user (e.g., `azureuser`) to run Docker commands, perform the following steps:

1. Add the user to the `docker` group:
   ```bash
   usermod -aG docker azureuser
   ```

2. Apply the changes by logging out and back in:
   ```bash
   exit
   ssh azureuser@<Public-IP-Address>
   ```

3. Test Docker without `sudo`:
   ```bash
   docker run hello-world
   ```

   If the setup is correct, the command will pull the `hello-world` image and display a welcome message.
